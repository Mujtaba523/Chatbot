Using 
1. Feed foward neural network: The goal of a feedforward network is to approximate some function f*. 
For example, for a classiﬁer, y = f*(x) maps an input x to a category y. A feedforward network deﬁnes a mapping y = f(x;θ) and 
learns the value of the parameters θ that result in the best function approximation.

2. Tokenization: Splitting a string into meaningful units(e.g words, punctuation character, numbers, etc)

3. Stemming: Generate the root form of the words(e.g "Organize", "Organizing"----> ["organ","organ"]

4. Bag of Words: A bag-of-words model, or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling, such as with machine learning algorithms.
The approach is very simple and flexible, and can be used in a myriad of ways for extracting features from documents.
A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:
	a) A vocabulary of known words.
	b) A measure of the presence of known words.
It is called a “bag” of words, because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded. The model is only concerned with whether known words occur in the document, not where in the document.
